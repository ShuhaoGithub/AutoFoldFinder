1.How to run trRosetta? 
Brief introduction for structure prediction by trRosetta

Step 0. Please generate an MSA (in a3m format) for your protein sequence from other softwares, such as HHblits (https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite).

Step 1. Using the generated MSA, predict the distance and orientations by running the scripts at: https://github.com/gjoni/trRosetta.

Step 2. Generate structure models from trRosetta (need to install PyRosetta3: http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow/pyrosetta3-download)  
>> python trRosetta.py T1008.npz T1008.fasta model.pdb

We suggest running step two for multiple times to generate multiple models and select the top models based on the energy scores, 
which are available at the end of the model's pdb file.

More details about trRosetta can be found from the following paper:
J Yang et al, Improved protein structure prediction using predicted inter-residue orientations, PNAS (2020).


2. How to convert the distance distribution in the npz file into distance and contact maps?
For convienience, a script is included in the package for this purpose:
>> python npz_2_dist.py seq.npz seq 


3. How to estimate the accuracy of the predicted models?
 Fig. S3B of the trRosetta paper shows that the model's TM-score correlates well with the probility of the predicted top contacts.
 Thus, you can roughly estimate the quality based on the average probablity of the top L predicted long+medium range contacts (|i-j|>12). 
 A script 'top_prob.py' was provided in the package to calculate this probability.
 
4. How to calculate and visualize the interresidue geometries (distance and orientation) from the input of a PDB structure?
 A script 'pdb2npz.py' was inlucded in the package to calculate and visualize the interresidue geometries in a PDB structure.
